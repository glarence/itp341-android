# Assignment 7 - Coffee Ordering with MVC and Persistent Data

* Create a UI that allows the user to specify the type of coffee they want
* Use MVC techniques to separate layers of program functionality
* Use an explicit intent to launch a new activity that displays the order to the user
* Allow the user to either confirm or cancel the order
